## Brief

Our web application connects individuals seeking digital tasks completed with skilled professionals who can efficiently accomplish these tasks for a fee, facilitating a seamless exchange of services and payments.

## Problem

In today's fast-paced digital world, individuals often struggle to find reliable and skilled professionals to complete their digital tasks efficiently and affordably. Existing platforms may lack transparency, quality control, or fail to adequately match task requirements with suitable talent. This results in wasted time, frustration, and potential quality issues for both clients and executors.

## Solution

Our web application addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly platform where individuals can easily post their digital tasks and connect with verified professionals who possess the necessary skills and expertise. Through transparent profiles, ratings, and reviews, clients can confidently select the right executor for their needs. Our platform streamlines the entire process, from task posting to payment, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience for both clients and executors. By fostering trust, efficiency, and convenience, we empower clients to efficiently accomplish their digital tasks while enabling skilled professionals to monetize their expertise.

### The release of funds for tasks and guides

Payfast and paystack will be crucial for all kinds of payment functionality to be used here. The support team will be able to release the funds to the executor once the task has been completed. The support team will then mark the task as completed, and the executor will be able to see that the task has been completed. The support team will then be able to download the proof of payment and then process the payment from the bank account of the company that owns the web application. The support team will then mark the payment as completed, and the executor will be able to see that the payment has been completed.

### Refunds

There should be an open window for a client to make a dispute about the task execution and potential refund. The support team will then investigate the dispute and then make a decision on whether the client should be refunded or not. The support team will then mark the task as refunded and then release the funds to the client. The support team will then be able to download the proof of payment and then process the payment from the bank account of the company that owns the web application. The support team will then mark the payment as completed, and the client will be able to see that the payment has been completed.
