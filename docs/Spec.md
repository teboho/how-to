# HowTo

How to do anything in the world. 

## Problem

People often have to wing their way through life, not knowing how to do things. This means that either, they don't do things, or they do them badly which can lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time and resources.

## Solution

I propose a web application that will allow those who have done something before to write a structured guide on how to do the said thing, with pictures and videos where necessary. Those who need help with regards to doing the specific thing can then come to the web application and search for the guide on how to do the thing. 

In a situation where the said thing is not available, the user can request for a guide on how to do the thing. The request will be sent to the community of users who have done the thing before, and they can then write a guide on how to do the thing.

The web application will also have a rating system where users can rate the guides on how helpful they were. This will help other users to know which guides are the best to use.

And lastly, users will be able to pay the guide writers for their work if they so wish. This will encourage more people to write guides on how to do things.

## Functional Requirements
